Mastermind Game README
Introduction
Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where players take turns either setting or guessing a sequence of colors. The game offers three modes of play, challenging both your strategic thinking and pattern recognition skills.

Game Modes
Guesser Mode:

The computer generates a secret code of colors.
Your goal is to guess the code in 12 turns or less.
Creator Mode:

You set a secret code of colors.
The computer attempts to guess your code in 12 turns or less.
Two-Player Mode:

One player sets the secret code.
The other player guesses the code.
How to Play
Setup:

At the start of the game, you will be greeted and asked to choose a mode.
A pool of colors will be displayed: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, pink, brown, silver.
Gameplay:

For each turn, enter four colors from the pool.
The system will provide feedback:
Black: A color is correct and in the right position.
White: A color is correct but in the wrong position.
Winning the Game:
